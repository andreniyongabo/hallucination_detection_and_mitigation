Important human migrations occurred in the Pacific in prehistoric times. Modern humans first reached the western Pacific in the Paleolithic, at around 60,000 to 70,000 years ago. Originating from an early coastal human migration out of Africa, they reached the Philippines, New Guinea, and Australia via the now sunken land bridges of Sundaland and Sahul. The descendants of these early migrations today are the highly diverse Australo-Melanesian peoples (including Negritos, Papuans, and Native Australians). These groups did not have boat or sailing technology and thus could only cross short distances of water. Their populations in maritime Southeast Asia, coastal New Guinea, and Island Melanesia later intermarried with the incoming Austronesian settlers, resulting in the modern peoples of Island Southeast Asia and Oceania.
