The harbour as a whole has considerable natural values and fauna of the inner and outer harbour differs.
There are pressures on the ecology from human activity such as settlements on the edge of the harbour and there is land and water-based industrial activity.

Almost without exception, the introduced species have been detrimental to the native flora and fauna but some, such as farmed sheep and cows and the clover upon which they feed, now form a large part of the economy of New Zealand..॥॥.sheep.॥॥.cows.॥॥.clover.॥॥.economy of New Zealand

The United States federal budget comprises the spending and revenues of the U.S. federal government..॥॥.United States federal budget.॥॥.revenues.॥॥.U.S. federal government
The budget is the financial representation of the priorities of the government, reflecting historical debates and competing economic philosophies.
The government primarily spends on healthcare, retirement, and defense programs.
The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office provides extensive analysis of the budget and its economic effects..॥॥.Congressional Budget Office
It has reported that large budget deficits over the next 30 years are projected to drive federal debt held by the public to unprecedented levels—from 98 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2020 to 195 percent by 2050.
Revenue
Congressional Budget Office

During FY2018, the federal government spent $4.11 trillion, up $127 billion or 3.2% vs.
FY2017 spending of $3.99 trillion.
Spending increased for all major categories and was mainly driven by higher spending for Social Security, net interest on the debt, and defense.
Spending as % GDP fell from 20.7% GDP to 20.3% GDP, equal to the 50-year average..॥॥.
Also during FY2018, the federal government collected approximately $3.33 trillion in tax revenue, up $14 billion or less than 1% versus FY2017.
Primary receipt categories included individual income taxes ($1,684B or 51% of total receipts), Social Security/Social Insurance taxes ($1,171B or 35%), and corporate taxes ($205B or 6%).
Corporate tax revenues declined by $92 billion or 32% due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act..॥॥.Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
FY 2018 revenues were 16.4% of gross domestic product (GDP), versus 17.2% in FY 2017..॥॥.gross domestic product
Tax revenues averaged approximately 17.4% GDP over the 1980-2017 period.
Tax revenues in 2018 were about $275 billion below the CBO January 2017 forecast for 2018, indicating tax revenues would have been considerably higher (and deficits lower) in the absence of the tax cuts.

Budget principles

The U.S. Constitution (Article I, section 9, clause 7) states that "No money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law; and a regular Statement and Account of Receipts and Expenditures of all public Money shall be published from time to time.".॥॥.U.S. Constitution.॥॥.Article I
Article One of the United States Constitution

Each year, the President of the United States submits a budget request to Congress for the following fiscal year as required by the Budget and Accounting Act of 1921..॥॥.Budget and Accounting Act of 1921
Current law (31 U.S.C. § 1105(a)) requires the president to submit a budget no earlier than the first Monday in January, and no later than the first Monday in February..॥॥.31.॥॥..॥॥.U.S.C..॥॥..॥॥.§.॥॥..॥॥.1105
Typically, presidents submit budgets on the first Monday in February.
The budget submission has been delayed, however, in some new presidents' first year when the previous president belonged to a different party.
Budget and Accounting Act of 1921

The federal budget is calculated largely on a cash basis.
That is, revenues and outlays are recognized when transactions are made.
Therefore, the full long-term costs of programs such as Medicare, Social Security, and the federal portion of Medicaid are not reflected in the federal budget.
By contrast, many businesses and some other national governments have adopted forms of accrual accounting, which recognizes obligations and revenues when they are incurred.
The costs of some federal credit and loan programs, according to provisions of the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990, are calculated on a net present value basis..॥॥.net present value

An American professor encouraged Hill to apply for a graduate program in the United States.
On the experience, in 2003, Hill wrote in The Siberian Curse, "I noticed that many aspects of British (and, by relation, American) culture were surprisingly, even unexpectedly similar, and that the Russians and the West had a good deal in common..॥॥.The Siberian Curse
Before long, other aspects of the Soviet and Russian [...] mentalities and cultures reared their heads, and these gaps seemed larger and more consuming than any novel or textbook could transmit".
Continuing in another passage, she writes, "Whether or not these gaps can be effectively bridged or, at least, mitigated will remain the guiding question for this field of study for decades to come".
Hill seemed to answer this question for herself in 2020, when she cowrote an op-ed in Politico Magazine, along with Jon Huntsman Jr., Robert Legvold, Rose Gottemoeller, and Thomas R. Pickering, wherein they state that, although Russia is and will likely remain greatly disharmonious with Western Europe and North America, it is in the security interests of the United States to seek cooperation where possible..॥॥.Politico Magazine.॥॥.Jon Huntsman Jr..॥॥.Robert Legvold.॥॥.Rose Gottemoeller.॥॥.Thomas R.

Analysis

South Carolina—a Deep Southern Bible Belt state that was once part of the conservative, Democratic Solid South—has had a Republican tendency since 1964 due to white South Carolinians' distaste for civil rights legislation..॥॥.South Carolina.॥॥.Deep Southern.॥॥.Bible Belt.॥॥.Solid South.॥॥.1964.॥॥.civil rights
This has been further cemented by Richard Nixon's Southern strategy, the only exception has been made for Jimmy Carter of neighboring Georgia in 1976..॥॥.Richard Nixon.॥॥.Southern strategy.॥॥.Jimmy Carter.॥॥.Georgia.॥॥.1976
It is the most conservative state on the East Coast of the United States, but not as conservative as other Deep Southern states (with the exception of the recently more competitive Georgia) due to its sizeable African-American population and populous urban areas of Richland County and Charleston County, both of which have steadily trended more Democratic in the 21st century..॥॥.East Coast of the United States.॥॥.Deep Southern.॥॥.African-American.॥॥.Richland County.॥॥.Charleston County

Trump performed somewhat better than polls anticipated, as aggregate polls averaged him only 7 points ahead of Biden.
In addition, he flipped Clarendon County for the first time since 1972 and Dillon County for the first time since 1988. [citation needed] Biden became the first Democrat since Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964 to win the presidency without Clarendon County and the first Democrat since Harry S. Truman to win without Dillon County..॥॥.Clarendon County.॥॥.1972.॥॥.Dillon County.॥॥.1988.॥॥..॥॥.[.॥॥.citation needed.॥॥.].॥॥.Lyndon B. Johnson.॥॥.Harry S. Truman

On September 7, 2019, the South Carolina Republican Party became one of several state GOP affiliates to cancel their respective primaries and caucuses officially..॥॥.South Carolina Republican Party
Donald Trump's re-election campaign and GOP officials have cited the fact that Republicans canceled several state primaries when George H. W. Bush and George W. Bush sought second terms in 1992 and 2004, respectively, and Democrats scrapped some of their primaries when Bill Clinton and Barack Obama were seeking re-election in 1996 and 2012, respectively..॥॥.George H.

In response to the cancellation, former U.S. Representative Bob Inglis and another South Carolina Republican voter filed a lawsuit against the South Carolina Republican Party on grounds that it denied their right to vote..॥॥.U.S. Representative.॥॥.Bob Inglis
On December 11, 2019, a state court judge dismissed the lawsuit, writing in his opinion that the law "does not give plaintiffs a legal right to presidential preference primary".
Thus at the South Carolina State Republican Convention in May 2020, the state party will formally bind all 50 of its national pledged delegates to Trump.

Feudal divisions and conflicts, and other obstacles to the exchange of goods and ideas that ancient Russian principalities before and especially during Mongol rule, strengthened dialectical differences and for a while prevented the emergence of the standardized national language.
The formation of the unified and centralized Russian state in 15th and 16th centuries and the gradual (re)emergence of a common political, economic, and cultural space have created the need for a common standard language.
The initial impulse for the standardization came from the government bureaucracy for the lack of a reliable tool of communication in administrative, legal, and judicial affairs became an obvious practical problem.
The earliest attempts at standardizing Russian were made based on the so-called Moscow official or chancery language, during the 15th to 17th centuries.
Since then the trend of language policy in Russia has been standardization in both the restricted sense of reducing dialectical barriers between ethnic Russians, and the broader sense of expanding the use of Russian alongside or in favour of other languages.

While Standard Mandarin is now the medium of instruction in schools throughout China, it still has yet to gain traction as a common language among the local population in areas where Mandarin dialects are not native.[28] In these regions,  people may be either diglossic or speak the standard language with a notable accent..॥॥.[28].॥॥.diglossic
However since the 21st century, there has been an effort of mass education in Standard Mandarin Chinese and discouragement of local language usage by the Chinese government in order to erase these regional differences.

Most of northeastern China, except for Liaoning, did not receive significant settlements by Han Chinese until the 18th century,[39] and as a result the Northeastern Mandarin dialects spoken there differ little from the Beijing dialect.[40] The Manchu people of the area now speak these dialects exclusively; their native language is only maintained in northwestern Xinjiang, where Xibe, a modern dialect, is spoken.[41].॥॥.Liaoning.॥॥.[39].॥॥.Northeastern Mandarin.॥॥.Beijing dialect.॥॥.[40].॥॥.Manchu people.॥॥.Xinjiang.॥॥.Xibe.॥॥.[41]

The frontier areas of Northwest China were colonized by speakers of Mandarin dialects at the same time, and the dialects in those areas similarly closely resemble their relatives in the core Mandarin area.[40] The Southwest was settled early, but the population fell dramatically for obscure reasons in the 13th century, and did not recover until the 17th century.[40] The dialects in this area are now relatively uniform.[42] However, long-established cities even very close to Beijing, such as Tianjin, Baoding, Shenyang, and Dalian, have markedly different dialects..॥॥.[40].॥॥.[40].॥॥.[42].॥॥.Beijing.॥॥.Tianjin.॥॥.Baoding.॥॥.Shenyang.॥॥.Dalian

History

Arabia boasted a wide variety of Semitic languages in antiquity.
In the southwest, various Central Semitic languages both belonging to and outside of the Ancient South Arabian family (e.g..॥॥.Central Semitic languages.॥॥.Ancient South Arabian
Southern Thamudic) were spoken.
It is also believed that the ancestors of the Modern South Arabian languages (non-Central Semitic languages) were also spoken in southern Arabia at this time..॥॥.Modern South Arabian languages
To the north, in the oases of northern Hejaz, Dadanitic and Taymanitic held some prestige as inscriptional languages..॥॥.Hejaz.॥॥.Dadanitic.॥॥.Taymanitic

Finally, on the northwestern frontier of Arabia, various languages known to scholars as Thamudic B, Thamudic D, Safaitic, and Hismaic are attested..॥॥.Safaitic.॥॥.Hismaic

Linguists generally believe that "Old Arabic" (a collection of related dialects that constitute the precursor of Arabic) first emerged around the 1st century CE.
Previously, the earliest attestation of Old Arabic was thought to be a single 1st century CE inscription in Sabaic script at Qaryat Al-Faw, in southern present-day Saudi Arabia..॥॥.Sabaic script.॥॥.Qaryat Al-Faw
However, this inscription does not participate in several of the key innovations of the Arabic language group, such as the conversion of Semitic mimation to nunation in the singular.
It is best reassessed as a separate language on the Central Semitic dialect continuum.

Abu al-Aswad al-Du'ali (c. 603–689) is credited with standardizing Arabic grammar, or an-naḥw (النَّحو "the way"), and pioneering a system of diacritics to differentiate consonants (نقط الإعجام nuqat l-i'jām "pointing for non-Arabs") and indicate vocalization (التشكيل at-tashkil)..॥॥.Abu al-Aswad al-Du'ali.॥॥.Arabic grammar.॥॥.an-naḥw.॥॥.النَّحو.॥॥.diacritics.॥॥.نقط الإعجام.॥॥.nuqat l-i'jām.॥॥.vocalization.॥॥.التشكيل.॥॥.at-tashkil

Spread

By the 8th century, knowledge of Classical Arabic had become an essential prerequisite for rising into the higher classes throughout the Islamic world, both for Muslims and non-Muslims.

Development

Charles Ferguson's koine theory (Ferguson 1959) claims that the modern Arabic dialects collectively descend from a single military koine that sprang up during the Islamic conquests; this view has been challenged in recent times..॥॥.koine
Ahmad al-Jallad proposes that there were at least two considerably distinct types of Arabic on the eve of the conquests: Northern and Central (Al-Jallad 2009).
The modern dialects emerged from a new contact situation produced following the conquests.
Instead of the emergence of a single or multiple koines, the dialects contain several sedimentary layers of borrowed and areal features, which they absorbed at different points in their linguistic histories.
According to Veersteegh and Bickerton, colloquial Arabic dialects arose from pidginized Arabic formed from contact between Arabs and conquered peoples..॥॥.pidginized

Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) largely follows the grammatical standards of Classical Arabic and uses much of the same vocabulary.
However, it has discarded some grammatical constructions and vocabulary that no longer have any counterpart in the spoken varieties and has adopted certain new constructions and vocabulary from the spoken varieties.
Much of the new vocabulary is used to denote concepts that have arisen in the industrial and post-industrial era, especially in modern times..॥॥.industrial.॥॥.post-industrial era
Due to its grounding in Classical Arabic, Modern Standard Arabic is removed over a millennium from everyday speech, which is construed as a multitude of dialects of this language.
These dialects and Modern Standard Arabic are described by some scholars as not mutually comprehensible.
The former are usually acquired in families, while the latter is taught in formal education settings.
However, there have been studies reporting some degree of comprehension of stories told in the standard variety among preschool-aged children.
The relation between Modern Standard Arabic and these dialects is sometimes compared to that of Classical Latin and Vulgar Latin vernaculars (which became Romance languages) in medieval and early modern Europe..॥॥.Classical Latin.॥॥.Vulgar Latin.॥॥.Romance languages

News Feed appears on every user's homepage and highlights information including profile changes, upcoming events and friends' birthdays..॥॥.News Feed
This enabled spammers and other users to manipulate these features by creating illegitimate events or posting fake birthdays to attract attention to their profile or cause.
Initially, the News Feed caused dissatisfaction among Facebook users; some complained it was too cluttered and full of undesired information, others were concerned that it made it too easy for others to track individual activities (such as relationship status changes, events, and conversations with other users).
Zuckerberg apologized for the site's failure to include appropriate privacy features.
Users then gained control over what types of information are shared automatically with friends.
Users are now able to prevent user-set categories of friends from seeing updates about certain types of activities, including profile changes, Wall posts and newly added friends.

In March and April 2021, in response to Apple announcing changes to its iOS device's Identifier for Advertisers policy, which included requiring app developers to directly request to users the ability to track on an opt-in basis, Facebook purchased full-page newspaper advertisements attempting to convince users to allow tracking, highlighting the effects targeted ads have on small businesses..॥॥.Identifier for Advertisers
Facebook's efforts were ultimately unsuccessful, as Apple released iOS 14.5 in late April 2021, containing the feature for users in what has been deemed "App Tracking Transparency".
Moreover, statistics from Verizon Communications subsidiary Flurry Analytics show 96% of all iOS users in the United States are not permitting tracking at all, and only 12% of worldwide iOS users are allowing tracking, which some news outlets deem "Facebook's nightmare", among similar terms..॥॥.Verizon Communications
Despite the news, Facebook has stated that the new policy and software update would be "manageable".
